<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Exhaust Gas Turbochargers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial flow</li><li>Axial flow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The exhaust gas turbocharger market is primarily divided into two types: radial flow and axial flow turbochargers. Radial flow turbochargers utilize centrifugal force to compress exhaust gases, making them efficient for smaller engines and providing quick response times. In contrast, axial flow turbochargers draw gases along the axis of rotation, offering higher efficiency and better performance at larger scales, suitable for heavy-duty applications. Both types enhance engine performance and fuel efficiency by increasing air intake and optimizing exhaust flow.</p></p>
