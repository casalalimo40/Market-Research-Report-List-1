<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Illumination Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Back-Illuminated Sensor</li><li>Front-Illuminated Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The illumination sensor market is primarily categorized into back-illuminated sensors and front-illuminated sensors. Back-illuminated sensors are designed to capture more light by placing the photodiode behind the circuit, resulting in improved sensitivity and lower noise levels, making them ideal for low-light environments. In contrast, front-illuminated sensors have their photodiodes in front of the circuit, which can limit light capture but allows for simpler designs and cost-effectiveness. Both types cater to varying applications in photography, industrial automation, and security systems.</p></p>
